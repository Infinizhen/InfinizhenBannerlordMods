			  These values represent the drop chance of an actual agent equipment item as loot.
				You can set a variable chance by tweaking Min and Max chances. 
        The drop chance will get calculated on every agent death.
        
        You have between 20-35% of getting a piece of equipment as a loot by default.
				Set Min and Max to an equal value to get a fixed drop chance.
        
        Values accepted: from 0.00 to 1.00
        
        If Min or Max < 0.00, then Min or Max=0.00
        If Min or Max > 1.00, then Min or Max=1.00
        If Max < Min, then Max=Min
