#ABOUT LOOT OVERHAUL
Loot Overhaul is a Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord mod that improves some in-game loot mechanics, as making lords drop their gear when executed or being able to configure the gear dropped by soldiers in battle. It also allows you to loot dead allies, too!

Loot Overhaul is compatible with both Master and Beta branches.
